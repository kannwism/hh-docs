## What is AgentMail?

AgentMail is an API platform designed specifically for AI agents to manage email communications. It provides agents with their own dedicated inboxes, enabling them to send, receive, and act upon emails just like humans do.

## Why AgentMail?

Email is a universal communication protocol that connects billions of people and services. By giving AI agents the ability to interact through email, you unlock:

- **Independent identities** for your agents
- **Seamless communication** with services, humans, and other agents
- **Event-driven workflows** through webhook integrations
- **Professional presence** with custom domain support
