## Overview

Inboxes are the foundation of AgentMail. Each inbox represents a unique email identity for your AI agent, complete with its own email address, message storage, and configuration.

## Creating an Inbox

Create a new inbox for your agent with a simple API call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agentmail.to/v1/inboxes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Customer Support Agent",
    "description": "Handles customer inquiries and support requests"
  }'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "inbox_abc123",
  "email": "agent-abc123@mail.agentmail.to",
  "name": "Customer Support Agent",
  "description": "Handles customer inquiries and support requests",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "active"
}
```

<Note>
  Each inbox gets a unique email address automatically. You can also configure custom domains for professional addresses.
</Note>

## Managing Inboxes

### List All Inboxes

Retrieve all inboxes in your account:

```bash
curl https://api.agentmail.to/v1/inboxes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Get a Specific Inbox

Retrieve details for a single inbox:

```bash
curl https://api.agentmail.to/v1/inboxes/inbox_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Update an Inbox

Modify inbox properties:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.agentmail.to/v1/inboxes/inbox_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Updated Agent Name",
    "status": "paused"
  }'
```

### Delete an Inbox

<Warning>
  Deleting an inbox is permanent and will remove all associated messages and threads!
</Warning>

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.agentmail.to/v1/inboxes/inbox_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Inbox Status

Inboxes can have three different statuses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check-circle" title="Active">
    The inbox can send and receive emails normally. This is the default status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="pause-circle" title="Paused">
    The inbox will receive emails but cannot send them. Useful for temporary suspension.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="ban" title="Disabled">
    The inbox cannot send or receive emails. Messages sent to disabled inboxes will bounce.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

### Dedicated Agent Inboxes

Create separate inboxes for different agent roles:

```javascript
// Create a support agent inbox
const supportInbox = await createInbox({
  name: "Support Agent",
  description: "Handles customer support inquiries"
});

// Create a sales agent inbox
const salesInbox = await createInbox({
  name: "Sales Agent",
  description: "Responds to sales leads and questions"
});

// Create a notification inbox
const notificationInbox = await createInbox({
  name: "Notification Service",
  description: "Sends automated notifications to users"
});
```

### Multi-Tenant Applications

Use inboxes to create isolated email environments for different customers or teams:

```javascript
// Create an inbox for each customer
async function onboardCustomer(customerId, customerName) {
  const inbox = await createInbox({
    name: `${customerName} Agent`,
    description: `Dedicated inbox for ${customerName}`,
    metadata: {
      customer_id: customerId
    }
  });

  return inbox;
}
```

## Best Practices

  Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the inbox's purpose. This helps with organization and debugging.
</Card>

<Card icon="tags" title="Metadata">
  Use the description field or custom metadata to track the inbox's role, associated users, or business context.
</Card>

<Card icon="shield" title="Status Management">
  Pause inboxes during maintenance or testing rather than deleting them to preserve message history.
